# WEBTECH 2020/2021
School subject focused on web applications.

These were my first attempts of creating some web pages, later web applications so don't judge me please :P

First half of branches contains just frontend(HTML+JS) webs whereas second half contains backend(PHP+MySQL) as well.

The code is most of the time kind of a mess and of course, today I would program it completely different and do it mainly Object Oriented and more dynamically but here it is what I've created back then. This is just an example branch of my previous work.
