# WEBTECH 2020/2021
School subject focused on web applications.

These were my first attempts of creating some web pages, later web applications so don't judge me please :P

First half of branches(01-07) contains just frontend(HTML+JS) webs whereas second half(08-14) contains backend(PHP+MySQL) as well.
There is also branch with big final project on which I've been working with another 3 classmates. It was web app used by teacher to create tests with different types of questions, different points for each question, automatically rated questions, drawing questions etc. Each test could be set to in/active omde and had generated unique code which was used by students to join and fill the test. There was also login system for teachers, checking if the student did exit the tab while in test and more and more..

Note:
The code is most of the time kind of a mess (except the last final project) and of course, today I would program it completely different and do it mainly Object Oriented and more dynamically but here it is what I've created back then. This is just an example branch of my previous work.
