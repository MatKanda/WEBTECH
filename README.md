# WEBTECH 2020/2021
School subject focused on web applications.

This was big final project on which I've been working with another 3 classmates. It was web app used by teacher to create tests with different types of questions like qustions with multiple answers, math questions, drawing questions, different points for each question, automatically rated questions etc. Each test could be set to in/active omde and had generated unique code which was used by students to join and fill the test. There was also login system for teachers, checking if the student did exit the tab while in test. Teacher was able to see who is currently doing the test and who has already finished. After the test was finished he was able to see student's answers and rate the test.
